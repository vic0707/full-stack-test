# README

This Project was made as part of my application to tuParroquia.com

It can be seen at https://tuparroquia.herokuapp.com/

I decided to use Ruby on Rails to develop this application as it is the language I am more confortable coding on.

I used the Bootstrap framework to help me give it a clean, profesional look.

I also coded an Api where the content off all the blog posts can be retrived. It can be seen at https://tuparroquia.herokuapp.com/api/v1/posts

Finally, I used react.js to render the front-end. The aproach I took was to first develop it in enbded html which I have experience on it. Since using react.js was one of the requirements, and I want to learn to use it, I decided to then modify the previous code and render the views with react.js
